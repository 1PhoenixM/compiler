*To build:

1. Install the node.js environment which includes NPM from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. In a terminal, run the following, according to http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial to install TypeScript:

> npm install -g typescript

3. In a terminal, assuming git is installed, run this OR use the "Download Zip" button on this repository, and unzip the archive file:

> git clone http://github.com/1PhoenixM/compiler

Then, navigate to the compiler/ folder in the terminal.

> cd compiler

4. Compile the compiler written in TypeScript with the TypeScript compiler... easy! Run:

> tsc compiler.ts

The resulting JavaScript is for the client-side, not server-side. Done building!

*To run:

1. Open the compiler.html file included in the repository in any web browser to use the compiler interface. The built JavaScript will run through this UI.
